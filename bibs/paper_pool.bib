  abstract  = {We study error estimating codes with the goal of establishing better bounds for the theoretical and empirical overhead of such schemes. We explore the idea of using sketch data structures for this problem, and show that the tug-of-war sketch gives an asymptotically optimal solution. The optimality of our algorithms are proved using communication complexity lower bound techniques. We then propose a novel enhancement of the tug-of-war sketch that greatly reduces the communication overhead for realistic error rates. Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive experimental evaluation.},

  abstract   = {Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data bits, and is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number of errors in a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we propose a novel error estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing code by more than 10\%-20\% depending on the packet sizes, as well as being more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based on the idea of grouping multiple blocks of sampled data bits into a super-block, thus creating a multi-dimensional feature, then compressing features into a single number, called the color, as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme, the blocks in a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which allows the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even in the presence of error. mEEC also adopts a lightweight redistribution step, which is guided by the solution of an optimization problem and further reduces the estimation errors and bias. We also show that mEEC can be implemented within reasonable table storage size and low time complexity.},
