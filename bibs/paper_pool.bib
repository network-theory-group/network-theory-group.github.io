We explore the idea of using sketch data structures for this problem, and show that the tug-of-war sketch gives an asymptotically optimal solution. The optimality of our algorithms are proved using communication complexity lower bound techniques. We then propose a novel enhancement of the tug-of-war sketch that greatly reduces the communication overhead for realistic error rates. Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive experimental evaluation.},

  abstract   = {Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data bits, and is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number of errors in a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we propose a novel error estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing code by more than 10\%-20\% depending on the packet sizes, as well as being more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based on the idea of grouping multiple blocks of sampled data bits into a super-block, thus creating a multi-dimensional feature, then compressing features into a single number, called the color, as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme, the blocks in a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which allows the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even in the presence of error. mEEC also adopts a lightweight redistribution step, which is guided by the solution of an optimization problem and further reduces the estimation errors and bias. We also show that mEEC can be implemented within reasonable table storage size and low time complexity.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

A well-known tabulating method computes s as well as the corresponding editing sequence in time and in space O(mn) (in space O(min(m, n)) if the editing sequence is not required). Starting from this method, we develop an improved algorithm that works in time and in space O(s · min(m, n)). Another improvement with time O(s · min(m, n)) and space O(s · min(s, m, n)) is given for the special case where all editing steps have the same cost independently of the characters involved. If the editing sequence that gives cost s is not required, our algorithms can be implemented in space O(min(s, m, n)). Since s = O(max(m, n)), the new methods are always asymptotically as good as the original tabulating method. As a by-product, algorithms are obtained that, given a threshold value t, test in time O(t · min(m, n)) and in space O(min(t, m, n)) whether s ⩽ t. Finally, different generalized edit distances are analyzed and conditions are given under which our algorithms can be used in conjunction with extended edit operation sets, including, for example, transposition of adjacent characters.},
