abstract: We study error estimating codes with the goal of establishing better bounds
  for the theoretical and empirical overhead of such schemes. We explore the idea
  of using sketch data structures for this problem, and show that the tug-of-war sketch
  gives an asymptotically optimal solution. The optimality of our algorithms are proved
  using communication complexity lower bound techniques. We then propose a novel enhancement
  of the tug-of-war sketch that greatly reduces the communication overhead for realistic
  error rates. Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive
  experimental evaluation.

        abstract: Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data
          bits, and is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number
          of errors in a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we
          propose a novel error estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing
          code by more than 10\%-20\% depending on the packet sizes, as well as being
          more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based on the idea of grouping multiple blocks
          of sampled data bits into a super-block, thus creating a multi-dimensional
          feature, then compressing features into a single number, called the color,
          as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme, the blocks in
          a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which allows
          the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even
          in the presence of error. mEEC also adopts a lightweight redistribution
          step, which is guided by the solution of an optimization problem and further
          reduces the estimation errors and bias. We also show that mEEC can be implemented
          within reasonable table storage size and low time complexity.

        abstract: "During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation\
          \ and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in\
          \ a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.\
          \ The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of\
          \ new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data\
          \ mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have\
          \ common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology.\
          \ This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual\
          \ framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts\
          \ rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of\
          \ color graphics. It is\_a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone\
          \ interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage\
          \ is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning.\
          \ The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification\
          \ trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in\
          \ any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered in the\
          \ original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods,\
          \ least angle regression \\& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative\
          \ matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter\
          \ on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing\
          \ and false discovery rates."

        abstract: An acoustic fingerprint is a condensed digital summary, a fingerprint,
          deterministically generated from an audio signal, that can be used to identify
          an  audio sample or quickly locate similar items in an audio database.Practical
          uses of acoustic fingerprinting include identifying songs, melodies, tunes,
          or advertisements; sound effect library management; and video file identification.
          Media identification using acoustic fingerprints can be used to monitor
          the use of specific musical works and performances on radio broadcast, records,
          CDs, streaming media and peer-to-peer networks. This identification has
          been used in copyright compliance, licensing, and other monetization schemes.

abstract: Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data bits, and
  is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number of errors in
  a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we propose a novel error
  estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing code by more than 10\%-20\%
  depending on the packet sizes, as well as being more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based
  on the idea of grouping multiple blocks of sampled data bits into a super-block,
  thus creating a multi-dimensional feature, then compressing features into a single
  number, called the color, as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme,
  the blocks in a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which
  allows the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even

        abstract: We study error estimating codes with the goal of establishing better
          bounds for the theoretical and empirical overhead of such schemes. We explore
          the idea of using sketch data structures for this problem, and show that
          the tug-of-war sketch gives an asymptotically optimal solution. The optimality
          of our algorithms are proved using communication complexity lower bound
          techniques. We then propose a novel enhancement of the tug-of-war sketch
          that greatly reduces the communication overhead for realistic error rates.
          Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive experimental
          evaluation.

        abstract: Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data
          bits, and is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number
          of errors in a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we
          propose a novel error estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing
          code by more than 10\%-20\% depending on the packet sizes, as well as being
          more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based on the idea of grouping multiple blocks
          of sampled data bits into a super-block, thus creating a multi-dimensional
          feature, then compressing features into a single number, called the color,
          as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme, the blocks in
          a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which allows
          the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even
          in the presence of error. mEEC also adopts a lightweight redistribution
          step, which is guided by the solution of an optimization problem and further
          reduces the estimation errors and bias. We also show that mEEC can be implemented
          within reasonable table storage size and low time complexity.

        abstract: "During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation\
          \ and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in\
          \ a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.\
          \ The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of\
          \ new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data\
          \ mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have\
          \ common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology.\
          \ This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual\
          \ framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts\
          \ rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of\
          \ color graphics. It is\_a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone\
          \ interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage\
          \ is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning.\
          \ The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification\
          \ trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in\
          \ any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered in the\
          \ original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods,\
          \ least angle regression \\& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative\
          \ matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter\
          \ on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing\
          \ and false discovery rates."

        abstract: An acoustic fingerprint is a condensed digital summary, a fingerprint,
          deterministically generated from an audio signal, that can be used to identify
          an  audio sample or quickly locate similar items in an audio database.Practical
          uses of acoustic fingerprinting include identifying songs, melodies, tunes,
          or advertisements; sound effect library management; and video file identification.
          Media identification using acoustic fingerprints can be used to monitor
          the use of specific musical works and performances on radio broadcast, records,
          CDs, streaming media and peer-to-peer networks. This identification has
          been used in copyright compliance, licensing, and other monetization schemes.

        abstract: We study error estimating codes with the goal of establishing better
          bounds for the theoretical and empirical overhead of such schemes. We explore
          the idea of using sketch data structures for this problem, and show that
          the tug-of-war sketch gives an asymptotically optimal solution. The optimality
          of our algorithms are proved using communication complexity lower bound
          techniques. We then propose a novel enhancement of the tug-of-war sketch
          that greatly reduces the communication overhead for realistic error rates.
          Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive experimental
          evaluation.

        abstract: Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data
          bits, and is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number
          of errors in a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we
          propose a novel error estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing
          code by more than 10\%-20\% depending on the packet sizes, as well as being
          more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based on the idea of grouping multiple blocks
          of sampled data bits into a super-block, thus creating a multi-dimensional
          feature, then compressing features into a single number, called the color,
          as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme, the blocks in
          a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which allows
          the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even
          in the presence of error. mEEC also adopts a lightweight redistribution
          step, which is guided by the solution of an optimization problem and further
          reduces the estimation errors and bias. We also show that mEEC can be implemented
          within reasonable table storage size and low time complexity.

          an  audio sample or quickly locate similar items in an audio database.Practical
          uses of acoustic fingerprinting include identifying songs, melodies, tunes,
          or advertisements; sound effect library management; and video file identification.
          Media identification using acoustic fingerprints can be used to monitor
          the use of specific musical works and performances on radio broadcast, records,
          CDs, streaming media and peer-to-peer networks. This identification has

        abstract: Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data
          bits, and is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number
          of errors in a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we
          propose a novel error estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing
          code by more than 10\%-20\% depending on the packet sizes, as well as being
          more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based on the idea of grouping multiple blocks
          of sampled data bits into a super-block, thus creating a multi-dimensional
          feature, then compressing features into a single number, called the color,
          as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme, the blocks in
          a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which allows
          the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even
          in the presence of error. mEEC also adopts a lightweight redistribution
          step, which is guided by the solution of an optimization problem and further
          reduces the estimation errors and bias. We also show that mEEC can be implemented
          within reasonable table storage size and low time complexity.

        abstract: An acoustic fingerprint is a condensed digital summary, a fingerprint,
          deterministically generated from an audio signal, that can be used to identify
          an  audio sample or quickly locate similar items in an audio database.Practical
          uses of acoustic fingerprinting include identifying songs, melodies, tunes,
          or advertisements; sound effect library management; and video file identification.
          Media identification using acoustic fingerprints can be used to monitor
          the use of specific musical works and performances on radio broadcast, records,
          CDs, streaming media and peer-to-peer networks. This identification has
          been used in copyright compliance, licensing, and other monetization schemes.

        abstract: We study error estimating codes with the goal of establishing better
          bounds for the theoretical and empirical overhead of such schemes. We explore
          the idea of using sketch data structures for this problem, and show that
          the tug-of-war sketch gives an asymptotically optimal solution. The optimality
          of our algorithms are proved using communication complexity lower bound
          techniques. We then propose a novel enhancement of the tug-of-war sketch
          that greatly reduces the communication overhead for realistic error rates.
          Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive experimental
          evaluation.

        abstract: Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data
          bits, and is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number
          of errors in a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we
          propose a novel error estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing
          code by more than 10\%-20\% depending on the packet sizes, as well as being
          more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based on the idea of grouping multiple blocks
          of sampled data bits into a super-block, thus creating a multi-dimensional
          feature, then compressing features into a single number, called the color,
          as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme, the blocks in
          a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which allows
          the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even
          in the presence of error. mEEC also adopts a lightweight redistribution
          step, which is guided by the solution of an optimization problem and further
          reduces the estimation errors and bias. We also show that mEEC can be implemented
          within reasonable table storage size and low time complexity.

        abstract: "During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation\
          \ and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in\
          \ a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.\
          \ The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of\
          \ new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data\
          \ mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have\
          \ common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology.\
          \ This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual\
          \ framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts\
          \ rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of\
          \ color graphics. It is\_a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone\
          \ interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage\
          \ is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning.\
          \ The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification\
          \ trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in\
          \ any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered in the\
          \ original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods,\
          \ least angle regression \\& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative\
          \ matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter\
          \ on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing\
          \ and false discovery rates."

        abstract: We study error estimating codes with the goal of establishing better
          bounds for the theoretical and empirical overhead of such schemes. We explore
          the idea of using sketch data structures for this problem, and show that
          the tug-of-war sketch gives an asymptotically optimal solution. The optimality
          of our algorithms are proved using communication complexity lower bound
          techniques. We then propose a novel enhancement of the tug-of-war sketch
          that greatly reduces the communication overhead for realistic error rates.
          Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive experimental
          evaluation.

        abstract: Error estimation code estimates the bit error ratio in the data
          bits, and is very useful in many applications, such as estimating the number
          of errors in a packet transmitted over a wireless link. In this paper, we
          propose a novel error estimation code, mEEC, that outperforms the existing
          code by more than 10\%-20\% depending on the packet sizes, as well as being
          more unbiased. mEEC is mainly based on the idea of grouping multiple blocks
          of sampled data bits into a super-block, thus creating a multi-dimensional
          feature, then compressing features into a single number, called the color,
          as the coded bits. Through an intelligent coloring scheme, the blocks in
          a super-block share the cost of covering low probability cases, which allows
          the decoder to recover the actual feature values from the color value even
          in the presence of error. mEEC also adopts a lightweight redistribution
          step, which is guided by the solution of an optimization problem and further
          reduces the estimation errors and bias. We also show that mEEC can be implemented
          within reasonable table storage size and low time complexity.

        abstract: "During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation\
          \ and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in\
          \ a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.\
          \ The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of\
          \ new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data\
          \ mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have\
          \ common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology.\
          \ This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual\
          \ framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts\
          \ rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of\
          \ color graphics. It is\_a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone\
          \ interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage\
          \ is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning.\
          \ The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification\
          \ trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in\
          \ any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered in the\
          \ original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods,\
          \ least angle regression \\& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative\
          \ matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter\
          \ on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing\
          \ and false discovery rates."
